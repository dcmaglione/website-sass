# website-sass
New personal website built using ReactJS and Sass over Spring '22. This repository contains all source files for the website. 

## Description
The portfolio contains a brief description of my field of study, interests, and hobbies. More professionally, the website contains my past experiences and campus leadership, alongside any relevant projects I have completed and/or are currently in development. Additionally, at the very bottom, my technical skills are listed. This website is continuously undergoing modifications and optimization as I bolster my skill set and learn more efficient development techniques.
